## Currently

Leveraging privacy-enhancing technologies to create synthetic census microdata

### Specialisms

Software development best practices, data synthesis, large-scale administrative
data analysis, algorithm evaluation


## Education

`2017-2021`
__PhD Applied Statistics, Operational Research and Data Analytics__,
Cardiff University

My thesis offers a thorough utilisation of machine learning techniques to
understand variation in healthcare data; this is achieved by assessing,
creating and applying machine learning techniques in a novel manner. The
results of this are new perspectives on algorithm evaluation and fair
clustering, as well as attaining actionable insights into a healthcare
population using routinely gathered, administrative datasets. In addition to
these contributions, my thesis is accompanied by a collection of
well-developed research software packages.

`2014-2017`
__BSc Mathematics__, Cardiff University

- *Key areas of study:* computing for mathematics, methods for data mining,
  operational research methods, game theory, algorithms and heuristics.
- *Projects:* simulating a hospital emergency department; analytical
  comparison of two strategies in an iterated Prisoner's Dilemma.


## Awards

`2023`
__Sustained Excellence Award__, *Office for National Statistics*

Internal recognition for leading a long-term project to synthesising a large,
linked census data product. I have had to work creatively to follow sustainable
development practices within the confines of the available trusted development environment.

`2022`
__3rd Place Prize__,
*United Nations Privacy Enhancing Technologies Lab*

Competed in a team of three, finishing third out of around two hundred
international teams in a [hackathon](https://datasciencecampus.ons.gov.uk/campus-in-the-top-three-at-the-un-pet-lab-hackathon)
centred around privacy-enhanced data analysis. We accurately predicted three
hidden characteristics (average 77%) of Kenyan refugee households using
open source tools for differential privacy inside a secure enclave.

`2018`
__Support for NATCOR Bursary__,
*Association of European Operational Research Societies*

Financial support to attend NATCOR courses in Approximation Algorithms and
Heuristics, and Predictive Analysis and Forecasting.

## Interests
<br>

### Cooking

I taught myself to cook as a child, then I worked as a chef while studying for
my A-levels, including at an AA Rosette restaurant. Cooking for friends and
family is now one of my dearest pastimes.

### Cycling

During the 2020 lockdowns I desperately needed something to occupy myself
outside of writing up my thesis. So, I taught myself bike mechanics and
renovated a vintage steel-frame touring bike.

### D&D

After years of listening to various Dungeons & Dragons podcasts, I now
run an all-homebrew campaign (designed by me) for my three brothers and our
partners.
