## Summary

I am a thoughtful, pragmatic, and ethically minded scientist. I have a breadth
of projects under my belt from large-scale health data analysis with machine
learning to productionising secure enclaves for record linkage. I find great
joy in picking up new tools and techniques, and in putting those skills to use
at pace.

Currently, I am leveraging LLMs to realise business efficiencies in the ONS,
and I champion the increased use of privacy-enhancing technologies (PETs)
across the Civil Service and Government.

Having successfully led numerous high-impact projects in academia and
government, I am now looking to apply my expertise as a data scientist and
software engineer in a new venture.

## Education

`2017-2021`
__PhD Applied Statistics, Operational Research and Data Analytics__&emsp;
*School of Mathematics, Cardiff University*

- [My thesis](https://github.com/daffidwilde/thesis) focuses on the thorough
  and ethical utilisation of machine learning in healthcare settings
- Key results include new perspectives on algorithm evaluation through data
  synthesis, and fair clustering
- My research provided actionable insights for my co-funders into a
  critical healthcare population in their care using only administrative data
- Accompanied by a suite of sustainably developed research software packages

`2014-2017`
__BSc Mathematics (First Class Honours)__&emsp;
*School of Mathematics, Cardiff University*

- Maintained a breadth of interests, including operational research, computing,
  and pure mathematics
- Received perfect scores for two projects: a simulation and analysis of a
  hospital emergency department, and an empirical comparison of two strategies
  in an iterated Prisoner's Dilemma


## Awards

`2022-2024`
__Reward and Recognition__&emsp; *Office for National Statistics*

I have earnt several internal awards in recognition of my contributions to data
science at the Office for National Statistics:

- __Sustained Excellence Award__ for my work leading a data synthesis project
  which spanned over a year. The award notes my commitment to sustainable
  software development practices in a restricted technical environment, and my
  essential role in establishing synthetic data as a part of the ONS'
  privacy-enhancing technologies strategy.
- __Great Contribution Award__ for encouraging and facilitating my team to
  adopt GitHub Projects as an effective project management tool following a
  team restructure. This tool has now been adopted in other teams at the
  Campus. I was also rewarded for disseminating my expertise in software
  development across other projects in the team, including setting up automated
  testing and continuous integration frameworks.
- __Great Contribution Award__ from another team for a piece of surge work I
  delivered at short-notice. I made use of Google BigQuery and distributed data
  science software to interrogate several large datasets on a new development
  platform. My analysis has since been used in live demonstrations and training
  materials across government.

`2022`
__3rd Place in PETs Hackathon__&emsp; *United Nations PET Lab*

Competed in a team of three, finishing third out of around two hundred
international teams in a [hackathon](https://datasciencecampus.ons.gov.uk/campus-in-the-top-three-at-the-un-pet-lab-hackathon)
centred around a real-world application of privacy-enhanced data analysis.
We accurately predicted three hidden characteristics of Kenyan refugee
households using open source tools for differential privacy inside a secure
enclave.

`2018`
__Support for NATCOR Bursary__&emsp;
*Association of European Operational Research Societies*

Financial support to attend NATCOR courses in Approximation Algorithms and
Heuristics, and Predictive Analysis and Forecasting.

## Interests
<br>

### Cooking

I taught myself to cook as a child, and then worked as a chef while at sixth
form, including at a former Michelin star restaurant. Cooking for friends and
family is now one of my dearest pastimes.

### Cycling

During the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, I desperately needed something to
occupy myself outside of writing my thesis. So, I taught myself bike mechanics
and renovated a vintage steel-frame touring bike.

### D & D

After years of listening to various Dungeons & Dragons podcasts, I now serve as
the game master in a homebrew campaign for my three brothers and our partners.
