## Summary

I am an experienced data scientist and software engineer with a breadth of
skills under my belt -- from large-scale, administrative data analysis to
productionising secure enclaves for record linkage. Currently, I am leveraging
LLMs to create business efficiencies in the ONS, and I champion the increased
use of privacy-enhancing technologies (PETs) across the Civil Service and
Government.

Having successfully led several projects in academia and government, I am now
looking to apply my expertise as a thoughtful and technically proficient data
scientist in a new venture.


## Employment

`May 2022 -
present`
__Data Scientist__&emsp; *Data Science Campus, Office for National Statistics*

I am the technical lead on a project synthesising England and Wales Census
products within the Privacy-Enhancing Technologies (PETs) squad at the Campus.
Working in an agile environment, I deliver large-scale synthetic datasets and
synthesis methods, and I contribute to the development of open-source tools for
privacy-preserving technologies. I am also an active participant in the
cross-government and international PETs communities, where I help influence
organisational policy on the uptake of PETs.

</div>

`Feb 2021 -
May 2022`
__Research Associate__&emsp; *Water Research Institute, Cardiff University*

I acted as the main contributor to software infrastructure and mathematical
modelling in the Welsh Government 
[wastewater surveillance programme](https://wastewatersurveillance.com).
The aim of the project was to improve public health monitoring via wastewater
sampling during the COVID-19 pandemic. As well as establishing reproducible
analytical pipelines in R, I developed statistical models to improve insights
into the ongoing pandemic. These included models for correcting
physico-chemical effects on SARS-CoV-2 measurements and a hierarchical model
for predicting COVID-19 prevalence across Wales.

<!-- My involvement in this project began as part of an
[international wastewater monitoring collaboration](https://cardiff.ac.uk/news/view/2499536-international-knowledge-exchange-projects-to-monitor-levels-of-covid-19-in-wastewater-worldwide)
with the University of Campinas, Brazil, funded by the Global Challenges
Research Fund. -->

`2019-2020`

__Project allocation consultancy__&emsp;
*School of Biosciences, Cardiff University*

The largest school in Cardiff University commissioned me to implement a more
efficient process for allocating dissertations to their final-year students.
The programmatic framework I installed, which relies on a
[Python library](https://daffidwilde.github.io/matching) I developed during my
PhD, reduced the School's workload from a week's work across the team to a
matter of seconds on a single computer. Moreover, the allocation it provides is
mathematically fair and student-optimal.

__Dissertation supervisor__&emsp;
*School of Mathematics, Cardiff University*

I assisted in the supervision of a MMORS final-year project conducting an
empirical study of Folk Theorems in repeated games. My primary role was to
consult on the supporting research software. I also took on pastoral
responsibilities and provided editorial assistance during the writing process.

`2017-2021`

__PhD studentship teaching__&emsp; *School of Mathematics, Cardiff University* 

I supported a number of modules and services as a tutor and assessment advisor,
including an introductory Python for Mathematics course, the university maths
support service, and multiple two-day hackathons for Masters students. I also
founded an Advanced Python Workshop for my fellow PhD students. These
roles provided me countless opportunities to reinforce teaching and learning in
a variety of environments, including group, one-on-one, structured, and drop-in
settings. This range allowed me to demonstrate my nature as a mathematician and
educator, one who is proactive, analytical, and enthusiastic.

## Education

`2017-2021`
__PhD Applied Statistics, Operational Research and Data Analytics__&emsp;
*School of Mathematics, Cardiff University*

My PhD was partially funded by a Welsh NHS Health Board, and my thesis focuses
on the thorough, ethical utilisation of machine learning techniques in
healthcare settings. The key results of my research include new perspectives on
algorithm evaluation and fair clustering, as well as actionable insights into a
healthcare population using routinely gathered, administrative data. In
addition to these contributions, my thesis is accompanied by a collection of
well-developed research software packages. I also took every opportunity to
disseminate my research through talks, live coding workshops, and poster
events.

`2014-2017`
__BSc Mathematics (First Class Honours)__&emsp;
*School of Mathematics, Cardiff University*

I maintained a breadth of interests throughout my degree, with modules spanning
operational research, computing, and pure mathematics. During my studies, I
received perfect scores for two projects. In one I simulated and analysed a
hospital emergency department, and the other comprised a comparison of two
game-theoretic strategies in an iterated Prisoner's Dilemma.


## Awards

`2022-2023`
__Reward and Recognition__&emsp; *Office for National Statistics*

I have earnt several internal awards in recognition of my contributions to data
science at the Office for National Statistics:

- __Sustained Excellence Award__ for my work leading a data synthesis project
  which spanned over a year. The award notes my commitment to sustainable
  software development practices in a restricted technical environment, and my
  essential role in establishing synthetic data as a part of the ONS'
  privacy-enhancing technologies strategy.
- __Great Contribution Award__ for encouraging and facilitating my team to
  adopt GitHub Projects as an effective project management tool following a
  team restructure. This tool has now been adopted in other teams at the
  Campus. I was also rewarded for disseminating my expertise in software
  development across other projects in the team, including setting up automated
  testing and continuous integration frameworks.
- __Great Contribution Award__ from another team for a piece of surge work I
  delivered at short-notice. I made use of Google BigQuery and distributed data
  science software to interrogate several large datasets on a new development
  platform. My analysis has since been used in live demonstrations and training
  materials across government.

`2022`
__3rd Place in PETs Hackathon__&emsp; *United Nations PET Lab*

Competed in a team of three, finishing third out of around two hundred
international teams in a [hackathon](https://datasciencecampus.ons.gov.uk/campus-in-the-top-three-at-the-un-pet-lab-hackathon)
centred around a real-world application of privacy-enhanced data analysis.
We accurately predicted three hidden characteristics of Kenyan refugee
households using open source tools for differential privacy inside a secure
enclave.

`2018`
__Support for NATCOR Bursary__&emsp;
*Association of European Operational Research Societies*

Financial support to attend NATCOR courses in Approximation Algorithms and
Heuristics, and Predictive Analysis and Forecasting.

## Interests
<br>

### Cooking

I taught myself to cook as a child, and then worked as a chef while at sixth
form, including at a former Michelin star restaurant. Cooking for friends and
family is now one of my dearest pastimes.

### Cycling

During the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, I desperately needed something to
occupy myself outside of writing my thesis. So, I taught myself bike mechanics
and renovated a vintage steel-frame touring bike.

### D & D

After years of listening to various Dungeons & Dragons podcasts, I now serve as
the game master in a homebrew campaign for my three brothers and our partners.
