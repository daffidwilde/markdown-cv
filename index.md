## Currently

Leveraging privacy-enhancing technologies to create synthetic census microdata

### Specialisms

Software development best practices, data synthesis, large-scale administrative
data analysis, algorithm evaluation


## Education

`2017-2021`
__PhD Applied Statistics, Operational Research and Data Analytics__,
Cardiff University

My thesis offers a thorough utilisation of machine learning techniques to
understand variation in healthcare data; this is achieved by assessing,
creating and applying machine learning techniques in a novel manner. The
results of this are new perspectives on algorithm evaluation and fair
clustering, as well as attaining actionable insights into a healthcare
population using routinely gathered, administrative datasets. In addition to
these contributions, my thesis is accompanied by a collection of
well-developed research software packages.

`2014-2017`
__BSc Mathematics__, Cardiff University

- *Key areas of study:* computing for mathematics, methods for data mining,
  operational research methods, game theory, algorithms and heuristics.
- *Projects:* simulating a hospital emergency department; analytical
  comparison of two strategies in an iterated Prisoner's Dilemma.


## Awards

`2023`
__Sustained Excellence Award__, *Office for National Statistics*

Internal recognition for individually leading work to synthesise a census data
product. In particular, I have had to work creatively to work according to best
practices within the confines of the available trusted development environment.

`2022`
__Third Place Prize__,
*United Nations Privacy Enhancing Technologies Lab*

Came third out of around two hundred international teams in a
[hackathon](https://datasciencecampus.ons.gov.uk/campus-in-the-top-three-at-the-un-pet-lab-hackathon)
centred around privacy-enhanced data analysis. We accurately predicted three
hidden characteristics (average 77%) of Kenyan refugee households using
open source tools for differential privacy inside a secure enclave.

`2018`
__Support for NATCOR Bursary__,
*Association of European Operational Research Societies*

Financial support to attend NATCOR courses in Approximation Algorithms and
Heuristics, and Predictive Analysis and Forecasting.
