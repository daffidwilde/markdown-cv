## Currently

### Specialisms

Software development best practices,
data synthesis,
large-scale administrative data analysis,
algorithm evaluation


## Employment

`May 2022 -
present`
__Data Scientist__&emsp; *Data Science Campus, Office for National Statistics*

I am the technical lead on a project synthesising England and Wales Census
products within the Privacy-Enhancing Technologies (PETs) squad at the Campus.
Working in an agile environment, I deliver large-scale synthetic datasets and
synthesis methods, and I contribute to the development of open-source tools for
privacy-preserving technologies. I am also an active participant in the
cross-government and international PETs communities, where I help influence
organisational policy on the uptake of PETs.

`Feb 2021 -
May 2022`
__Research Associate__&emsp; *Water Research Institute, Cardiff University*

I acted as the main contributor to software infrastructure and mathematical
modelling in the Welsh Government 
[wastewater surveillance programme](https://wastewatersurveillance.com).
The aim of the project was to improve public health monitoring via wastewater
sampling during the COVID-19 pandemic. As well as establishing reproducible
analytical pipelines in R, I developed statistical models to improve insights
into the ongoing pandemic. These included models for correcting
physico-chemical effects on SARS-CoV-2 measurements and a hierarchical model
for predicting COVID-19 prevalence across Wales.

<!-- My involvement in this project began as part of an
[international wastewater monitoring collaboration](https://cardiff.ac.uk/news/view/2499536-international-knowledge-exchange-projects-to-monitor-levels-of-covid-19-in-wastewater-worldwide)
with the University of Campinas, Brazil, funded by the Global Challenges
Research Fund. -->

`2019-2020`
__Project allocation consultancy__&emsp;
*School of Biosciences, Cardiff University*

The largest school in Cardiff University commissioned me to implement a more
efficient process for allocating dissertations to their final-year students.
The programmatic framework I installed, which relies on a
[Python library](https://matching.readthedocs.io) I developed during my PhD,
reduced the School's workload from a week to a matter of seconds. Moreover, the
allocation it provides is mathematically fair and student-optimal.

__Dissertation supervisor__&emsp;
*School of Mathematics, Cardiff University*

I assisted in the supervision of a MMORS final-year project conducting an
empirical study of Folk Theorems in repeated games. My primary role was to
consult on the supporting research software. I also took on pastoral
responsibilities and provided editorial assistance during the writing process.

`2017-2021`
__PhD studentship teaching__&emsp; *School of Mathematics, Cardiff University* 

Throughout my PhD, I supported a number of modules and services as a tutor and
assessment advisor.
Notable roles include an introductory Python for Mathematics course, a
university-wide maths support service, and assessing multiple two-day
hackathons for Masters students.
These roles provided me countless opportunities to
reinforce teaching and learning in a variety of environments, including group,
one-on-one, structured, and drop-in settings. This range allowed me to
demonstrate my nature as a mathematician and educator, one who is proactive,
analytical, and enthusiastic.

## Education

`2017-2021`
__PhD Applied Statistics, Operational Research and Data Analytics__&emsp;
*School of Mathematics, Cardiff University*

My PhD was partially funded by a Welsh NHS Health Board, and my thesis focuses
on the thorough, ethical utilisation of machine learning techniques in
healthcare settings. The key results of my research include new perspectives on
algorithm evaluation and fair clustering, as well as actionable insights into a
healthcare population using routinely gathered, administrative data. In
addition to these contributions, my thesis is accompanied by a collection of
well-developed research software packages. I also took every opportunity to
disseminate my research through talks, live coding workshops, and poster
events.

`2014-2017`
__BSc Mathematics (First Class Honours)__&emsp;
*School of Mathematics, Cardiff University*

I maintained a breadth of topics throughout my undergraduate degree, with
modules spanning operational research, discrete mathematics, computing, and
pure mathematics. During my studies, I also received perfect scores for two
projects. In one I simulated and analysed a hospital emergency department, and
the other comprised a comparison of two game-theoretic strategies in an
iterated Prisoner's Dilemma.


## Awards

`2023`
__Sustained Excellence Award__&emsp; *Office for National Statistics*

Internal recognition for leading the technical development of a long-term
project synthesising a large, linked census data product.
<!-- I have had to work creatively to follow sustainable development practices
within the confines of the available trusted development environment. -->

`2022`
__3rd Place Prize__&emsp;
*United Nations Privacy Enhancing Technologies Lab*

Competed in a team of three, finishing third out of around two hundred
international teams in a [hackathon](https://datasciencecampus.ons.gov.uk/campus-in-the-top-three-at-the-un-pet-lab-hackathon)
centred around a real-world application of privacy-enhanced data analysis.
<!-- We accurately predicted three hidden characteristics (average 77%) of Kenyan
refugee households using open source tools for differential privacy inside a
secure enclave. -->

`2018`
__Support for NATCOR Bursary__&emsp;
*Association of European Operational Research Societies*

Financial support to attend NATCOR courses in Approximation Algorithms and
Heuristics, and Predictive Analysis and Forecasting.

## Interests
<br>

### Cooking

I taught myself to cook as a child, then I worked as a chef while studying for
my A-levels, including at an AA Rosette restaurant. Cooking for friends and
family is now one of my dearest pastimes.

### Cycling

During the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, I desperately needed something to
occupy myself outside of writing my thesis. So, I taught myself bike mechanics
and renovated a vintage steel-frame touring bike.

### D & D

After years of listening to various Dungeons & Dragons podcasts, I now serve as
the game master in a homebrew campaign for my three brothers and our partners.
