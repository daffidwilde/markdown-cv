## Summary

I am a thoughtful, ethically minded scientist with a track record of pragmatism
and efficient, impactful work. I have a breadth of projects under my belt from
large-scale health data analysis with machine learning to productionising
secure enclaves for record linkage. I find great joy in picking up new tools
and techniques, and in putting those skills to use at pace.

Currently, I am leveraging LLMs to realise business efficiencies in the ONS,
and I champion the increased use of privacy-enhancing technologies (PETs)
across the Civil Service and Government.

Having successfully led numerous high-impact projects in academia and
government, I am now looking to apply my expertise as a data scientist and
software engineer in a new venture.

## Interests
<br>

### Cooking

I taught myself to cook as a child, and then worked as a chef while at sixth
form, including at a former Michelin star restaurant. Cooking for friends and
family is now one of my dearest pastimes.

### Cycling

During the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, I desperately needed something to
occupy myself outside of writing my thesis. So, I taught myself bike mechanics
and renovated a vintage steel-frame touring bike.

### D & D

I adore fantasy in all its forms. Now, after years of listening to Dungeons &
Dragons podcasts, I serve as the game master in a homebrew campaign for my
three brothers.
